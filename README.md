# DESIGN DETAILED DOCUMENT

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK:
    In this repository you can find everything backing up my personal webpage (HTML files, CSS, images, License..). 
    
    The webpage consists of different sections;

    1. INDEX: First thing to appear as the webpage is entered. At the top, the user can find a menu which will be maintained in every section and which can be used to navigate through the webpage. At the bottom, a footer section is also displayed. Then, five interactive pictures (one per section) are shown. If clicked, each of them will redirect the user to the section they represent.
    2. CONTACT: Four ways to approach myself are offered:
        1. Social Media (Which are also found in the about me section)
        2. Phone
        3. E-Mail
        4. Through the webpage. Users can introduce messages but they do not actually get to me, as the webpage is not prepared to storage them. 
    3. NETWORK: Here, the user can find a graph which contains five pictures of five different people. The top one is mine, which conducts to the Index section. The rest correspond to mates and if their photograph is clicked it will redirect you to their projects.
    4. TOPIC: In this section, an essay about deepfake detection is shown. Introduction, Technologies involved, Strengths and Weaknesses, Technology's viability, Usage and Potential evolution, Ethics and Conclusion are covered.
    5. DEGREE: Information about the degree "Mathematical Engineering + Computer Science" is displayed. Purpose, Structure and Curriculum can be accesed by the user. If any of the titles of each academic year is clicked, the user is reconducted to another page which shows a brief description of each subject. In the first year section, the subject "Fundamentals of Computer Engineering" can be found. If the title is again clicked, you access an expanded version in which you can read more information about it.
    6. ABOUT ME: In this section, you may find anwser to two questions: "Who am I?" and "Who am I going to be". Both questions were inspired by the information obtained by Units 2 and 3 of FCE. Then, my Curriculum Vitae is displayed. In the end, the user finds three icons of three different social media that if clicked, will reconduct you to each of them respectively.

2. PROBLEMS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT:
    Being this project my first contact both with HTML and CSS, obviously most of the problems faced relate to them.

    1. Display problems: Trying to create an appropiate display, both comfortable and appealing, was a specially ardous task. Centering items, mantaining margins, positioning texts or images, and, generally speaking, tranforming my designs from paper to the screen was a nightmare.
    2. Sintaxis problems: As a result of my lack of knowledge, I obviously had to look up some information outside my brain. Even though the presentations of FCE provide a more than appropiate basis, some of the things I wanted to include were not found there. Consequently, I started surfing on internet. The problem was that most of the things included a high complexity of sintaxis which made it quite difficult for me to understand them, therefore deciding to discard some ideas I still recall as brilliant.
    3. Content problems: Despite most of my time was devoted to CSS and HTML affairs, I also had to spend hours making up the information showcased in the webpage. At first, I read the instructions on a rush what provoked myself not to notice some important things, such as the requirment of a brief explanation of each subject contained in the programm. 

3. CONCLUSIONS:

    However much I suffered for this project to be completed, I have to admit that the outcome was more than positive. I advocate for the practical approach when it comes to gain knowledge, and this was not the exception. However much I understood the HTML and CSS sintaxis before, this project has given me confidence to handle them. 

    Furthermore, maybe because my background are other languages such as C++ and Python, I don't enjoy the experience of programming in HTML and CSS, as I find them extremely tedious. The future might change this vision, but for the moment that is my general opinion about them.

                <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
                    <p>Hi! I'm Jose Segura. 19 years ago I was born in Malaga, where I grew up before leaving behind my home to study in Madrid. 
                        There, I started studying biomedical engineering at Rey Juan Carlos University. However, after 4 months lacking personal acomplishment,
                        I decided to move to Francisco de Victoria University and start studying Mathematical Engineering and Computer Science. 
                        During my first year, I worked as a public speaking teacher, preparing people for conferences, tournaments and, in general, to speak properly.
                        With the passage of time, in colaboration with two collegues I started running my own business related to this area. </p>

                    <h1>WHO AM I GOING TO BE?</h1>
                    <p>However much I have tried to give an anwser to the aforementioned question, I still haven't make up my mind. 
                        The thing is that my knowledge field has experiened a huge transformation in just a few years,
                        and the rythm doesn't seem to slow. Therefore, is quite difficult to have a clear idea of what you'd 
                        like to do in the future when it changes so dramatically almost everyday. This is not a problem for me, 
                        probably because what I like the most about my degree is actually how innovative it is. Now, my purpose is to
                        be as holistically prepared as possible, so when the future arrives I'm ready to face whatever it brings with it.</p>
